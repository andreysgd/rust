Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety-ensuring that all references point to valid memory-without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its borrow checker tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust borrows ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.
